                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hello! I am Charlie and I am a portraits photographer located in Anchorage, Alaska.  I specialize in Beauty-Glamour, Children-Family, Mother-Daughter, Generations, Personal Branding and Senior portraits. I love my job! I love to be creative and to meet with new people every day. I love to hear my clients’ perspectives on their own photographs. I am always thrilled when my clients send me messages saying how happy they are with their photography session and how excited they are to see their photos. </p>

                        <p>One of the best parts of my work is hearing that I could boost someone’s confidence by helping them finally see their own beauty. By trying to capture the unique loveliness that each person has, perhaps I can help them feel comfortable in their own skin. </p>

                        <p>It is so important to have professional photos of ourselves and of the people in our lives because it is something we can treasure forever. There is no need for a special occasion to get photos done. Maybe you just want to update your photos for your website or blog. Maybe you would like some senior year photos done of yourself. Maybe you would like photos with your mom, your children, your sister or best friend to celebrate your relationship with them. Or perhaps you simply want to celebrate your life. Whatever the reason, I am here to help capture these moments in photographic art</p>

                        <h2>My Mission</h2>
                        <p> I want to help build the self-esteem of every single woman I meet by showing them how beautiful they are. I want to photograph you the way you want to be photographed. I want to customize your photo session the way you like it. It is my mission to provide a safe, compassionate environment where women of all ages can celebrate their life and see themselves as the most beautiful women in the world. </p>
                        <p>I invite you to check out my website and Facebook page, and I would like to hear from you! Please feel free to send me a message or email me so I can get to know you, and maybe one day I will be your photographer. </p>
